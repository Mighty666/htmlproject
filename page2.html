    <h1>Reasons why I like Summer!</h1>
    <p>Summer is a season where I can hangout with my friends, go to beaches, and not have to be stressed over school.</p><p> The season allows us to play outside and enjoy the outdoors.</p><p> I also have as much time as I want to do hobbies, hangout with friends, go to movies, and even vacations!</p><p> We do not have to stress over big tests in school or waste half our day learning.</p><p> Summer is also the perfect time to go to a beach and hang out in the warm ocean.</p><p> The season also allows to spend as much time with our friends and family as possible.</p><p> The season also has Independence day, which we can light up the sky with fireworks!</p><p> Summer is in general a great season because we have so much time to spend and none to lose.</p>
